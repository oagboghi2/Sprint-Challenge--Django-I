This week, I encountered below huddles:
 1. Too many terminals
  - I ws unable to get my website fully deployed. I ran into an issue 
 2. Lack of the knwoledge
  - It was diffucult to debug at times, becuase it ws diffucult to follow along withe structure of the app.
  - I do wish there has been a bit mre explanation on how django worked, and sort fo the through process behind it, as compared to the step by step nstructions we had. Eventually I figured stuff out, but it required a lot of head banging against the wall.
 
 I have my djano app up and running, able to accept new user and data, I will update in the future when I figure out the heroku issue I'm having.
